## Hi there 👋

Holonym is a decentralized identity protocol based on zero-knowledge proofs. It enables compliant but privacy-preserving KYC, along with Sybil resistance and miscellaneous proofs (proof of age, proof of residency, proof of accredited investor status, etc.). To learn more, check out our 
[docs](https://docs.holonym.id). 
If you are interested in integrating Holonym into your app/protocol or contributing to the project, please [reach out](mailto:hello@holonym.id)
