## welcome 👋

these repositories are maintained by **Holonym Foundation** and together form the [**human.tech**](https://human.tech) framework: *a system of modular and interoperable protocols designed to empower humans with **security**, **privacy**, and **digital personhood*** 

human.tech infrastructure places **humans at the center of technology**—not governments, corporations, or machines

---

### 🛠️ the framework

we maintain and support:

- [**Human Network**](https://app.othentic.xyz/avs/0x42f15f9e4df4994317453477e80e24797cc1a929) - a threshold-based verifiable Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (vOPRF) protocol for secure onboarding, portable private identity, Sybil resistance, and non-custodial key recovery
- [**Human Keys**](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/glossary/human-keys) - secure, user-friendly credentials generated from biometrics, devices, web accounts, or other secrets that enable seamless crypto onboarding, recoverability, and robust security for digital identity and asset custody
- [**Human Wallet**](https://wallet.human.tech) – an emeddable wallet as a protocol (WaaP) built on 2PC-MPC for top security and developer flexibility with social signin and trustless multi-factor authentication
- [**Human Passport**](https://passport.human.tech) (formerly Gitcoin Passport) – secure and private digital personhood through flexible identity verification, supporting methods like decentralized web-of-trust, pseudonymous reputation, KYC credentials, NFC e-passport attestations, and biometrics
- [**Covenant of Humanistic Technology**](manifest.human.tech) – adaptive protocol for ensuring that every system, service, and governance decision within human.tech reflects and reinforces human dignity, privacy, decentralization, and sovereign control.
- [**$HUMN**](https://human.tech/token) – powering access, governance, and coordination across the network.
